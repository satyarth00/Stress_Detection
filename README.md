😰 Stress Detection with Emotions – Real-Time Emotion Recognition using CNN
A Python-based deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV to recognize facial expressions in real-time and detect stress levels based on emotional cues.

⚠️ Note: This project uses your computer’s webcam for real-time facial emotion detection and must be run locally.

Download Dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013 After downloading, you will have a zip file, extract it, and copy the location of that folder in section-2 of the code.

🚀 Features
🎥 Real-time emotion detection using OpenCV
🧠 Deep Learning model (CNN) trained on facial emotion datasets
📊 Classifies emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise
😓 Maps emotions to stress levels (e.g., Highly Stressed, Low Stressed, Not Stressed)
📁 Support for custom image dataset with folder-based structure
🧪 Optional webcam-based emotion monitoring
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.9+ (✅ tested with Python 3.13.2)
tensorflow, keras
opencv-python
scikit-learn
numpy, pandas
matplotlib (for visualization)
pywin32 (📍Windows only – required for webcam access)
📦 Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stress-Detection-With-Emotions.git
cd Stress-Detection-With-Emotions
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ Make sure:

Your system has a working webcam
You're using Python 3.9–3.10 (TensorFlow not yet supported on 3.11+)
🧑‍💻 How to Run
🧠 Train the CNN Model:
python train_model.py
This will train your model on the dataset inside the train/ and test/ folders and save the model as model.h5.

👁️ Start Real-Time Emotion & Stress Detection:
python detect_stress.py
This opens your webcam, detects faces, classifies emotions, and displays stress level in real-time.
