😰 Stress Detection with Emotions – Real-Time Emotion Recognition using CNN
A Python-based deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV to recognize facial expressions in real-time and detect stress levels based on emotional cues.

⚠️ Note: This project uses your computer’s webcam for real-time facial emotion detection and must be run locally.

🚀 Features
🎥 Real-time emotion detection using OpenCV

🧠 Deep Learning model (CNN) trained on facial emotion datasets

📊 Classifies emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise

😓 Maps emotions to stress levels (e.g., Highly Stressed, Low Stressed, Not Stressed)

📁 Support for custom image dataset with folder-based structure

🧪 Optional webcam-based emotion monitoring

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.9+ (✅ tested with Python 3.13.2)

tensorflow, keras

opencv-python

scikit-learn

numpy, pandas

matplotlib (for visualization)

pywin32 (📍Windows only – required for webcam access)

📦 Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stress-Detection-With-Emotions.git
cd Stress-Detection-With-Emotions
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ Make sure:

Your system has a working webcam

You're using Python 3.9–3.10 (TensorFlow not yet supported on 3.11+)

🧑‍💻 How to Run
🧠 Train the CNN Model:
bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
This will train your model on the dataset inside the train/ and test/ folders and save the model as model.h5.

👁️ Start Real-Time Emotion & Stress Detection:
bash
Copy
Edit
python detect_stress.py
This opens your webcam, detects faces, classifies emotions, and displays stress level in real-time.
